Django-RemindMe is a small example app for emailing reminders. It was built
to demonstrate the feature set of the Hitch Testing Framework.

It is built using the following:

* Django
* Celery
* Postgresql
* Redis
* Cron
* Bootstrap
* Django crispy forms
* Django all-auth

There are some example tests in the project Django-RemindMe-Tests_ which
you can clone inside this repository and run directly. Click the link
and see the README for more details on how to run the tests (it's very easy).
